We work with commercial fisheries data and struggle to share information with coworkers who aren't using the same software as we are.

## The Challenge: ~~Accessible Geospatial Data Sharing~~ \nMake an interactive map

- Traditional mapping applications often require:
  - Servers
  - Expensive hosting solutions
  - Complex installation processes
- This creates barriers for:
  - Small organizations
  - Individual researchers
  - Citizen scientists
  
::: notes

I want to share cool interactive maps with with coworkers, etc. There is an expectation to zoom, pan, and click on maps for more information. Traditionally that has required more enterprise level tools, or a server to host the app. Maybe even some software that can be complex to install. (Do you need admin rights?)

This makes it hard for small players with small budgets to create the kind of data visualizations that people are expecting. A static map in a pdf just doesn't cut it anymore. We've been looking for ways

## Free and Open-Source Options
- Addresses cost and issues associated with being locked into proprietary software, but:
  - Organizational restrictions on installation
  - Platform compatibility
  - Technical expertise of recipients

## Enter Shiny Live: A Game-Changer

- Web-based solution for interactive applications
- Leverages WebAssembly technology
- Allows creation of lightweight, serverless apps
- Supports both R and Python

## What is WebAssembly?

- Low-level language for web browsers
- Near-native performance
- Enables running complex applications in the browser
- Key to Shiny Live's ability to run R and Python without a server
- Something about javascript

## Shiny Live: Key Features

- No server required
- Runs entirely in the browser
- Supports file uploads
- Secure
- Integrates with popular libraries (e.g., leaflet)
- Works with both R and Python

## Demo: R Shiny Live App

[Insert screenshot or live demo of a simple R Shiny Live app here]

- Upload geospatial data
- Visualize on an interactive map
- Perform basic analysis

## Demo: Python Shiny Live App

[Insert screenshot or live demo of a simple Python Shiny Live app here]

- Similar functionality to R app
- Demonstrates language flexibility

## Benefits for Users

- No installation required
- Access advanced geospatial tools through a web browser
- Upload and analyze personal data securely
- Collaborate easily by sharing a single URL

## Getting Started with Shiny Live

1. Install Shiny for Python or R
2. Create your Shiny app
3. Use Shiny Live to convert it for browser use
4. Deploy on GitHub Pages or similar platforms

## Conclusion: Democratizing Geospatial Analysis

- Shiny Live removes barriers to geospatial data sharing
- Empowers a wider audience to create and use mapping applications
- Encourages innovation and collaboration in geospatial analysis
