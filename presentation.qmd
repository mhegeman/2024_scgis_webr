## The Challenge: Accessible Geospatial Data Sharing

- Traditional mapping applications often require:
  - Servers
  - Expensive hosting solutions
  - Complex installation processes
- This creates barriers for:
  - Small organizations
  - Individual researchers
  - Citizen scientists

## Enter Shiny Live: A Game-Changer

- Web-based solution for interactive applications
- Leverages WebAssembly technology
- Allows creation of lightweight, serverless apps
- Supports both R and Python

## What is WebAssembly?

- Low-level language for web browsers
- Near-native performance
- Enables running complex applications in the browser
- Key to Shiny Live's ability to run R and Python without a server

## Shiny Live: Key Features

- No server required
- Runs entirely in the browser
- Supports file uploads
- Integrates with popular libraries (e.g., leaflet)
- Works with both R and Python

## Demo: R Shiny Live App
