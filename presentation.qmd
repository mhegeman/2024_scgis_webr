- We work with commercial fisheries data and struggle to share information with coworkers who aren't using the same software as we are.  
- Use R and Python on the daily.
- WebAssembly allows users to use R and Python in the browser, not installation required.

::: notes
Who we are and why you should listen to us. We've been using R (and Python) on the daily for years and struggle when we want less technical people to be able to use the tools we build. 

Mapping has been a real sticking point lately. Things like Google Maps have set peoples expectations pretty high. People want to zoom, pan, and click on maps for more information. Traditionally that functionality has required more enterprise level tools, or a server to host the app. More resources than an average person has available.

## Some Common Roadblocks

- Expensive servers and hosting solutions 💰  
- Proprietary software 💾
- Complex installation processes 🧩 
- Ongoing maintenance 🛠

::: notes

The costs of the hardware and software needed to run mapping applications make it difficult for:  
- Small organizations  
- Individual researchers  
- Citizen scientists  
:::


## The Challenge: 

- Make an interactive map 🗺
- Compare two data sources 💻
- Keep it private 🔏
- Keep it consistent ✅


::: notes

Our goal was to create a basic, light-weight interactive map that will allow users to compare two sets of data, the map and data don't have to be make public for it to be free, and will allow a reproducible analysis. 

:::



## Free and Open-Source Options


- Addresses cost and issues associated with being locked into proprietary software, but:
  - Organizational restrictions on installation
  - Platform compatibility
  - Technical expertise of recipients
  
::: notes
Bobby
Our preference is always free and open-source software. This is important for cost issues, but also makes everything more repeatable. 
:::

## R is for everyone (?)

Used local Shiny Apps to get around this limitations, but...  

Requires the user to have and maintain a local R installation, clone the app, etc.  

::: notes
Show of hands for those who use R? Python? Shiny? Streamlit? If you've used any of this programs, you know that you can't just expect anyone to be able to run them.

## R and Python in the browser

What if R and Python were already in your browser?

## Enter Shiny Live: A Game-Changer

- Web-based solution for interactive applications
- Leverages WebAssembly technology
- Allows creation of lightweight, serverless apps
- Supports both R and Python

## What is WebAssembly?

- Low-level language for web browsers
- Near-native performance
- Enables running complex applications in the browser
- Key to Shiny Live's ability to run R and Python without a server
- Something about javascript

## Shiny Live: Key Features

- No server required
- Runs entirely in the browser
- Supports file uploads
- Secure
- Integrates with popular libraries (e.g., leaflet)
- Works with both R and Python

## Demo: R Shiny Live App

[Insert screenshot or live demo of a simple R Shiny Live app here]

- Upload geospatial data
- Visualize on an interactive map
- Perform basic analysis

## Demo: Python Shiny Live App

[Insert screenshot or live demo of a simple Python Shiny Live app here]

- Similar functionality to R app
- Demonstrates language flexibility

## Benefits for Users

- No installation required
- Access advanced geospatial tools through a web browser
- Upload and analyze personal data securely
- Collaborate easily by sharing a single URL/file

## Getting Started with Shiny Live

1. Install Shiny for Python or R
2. Create your Shiny app
3. Use Shiny Live to convert it for browser use
4. Deploy on GitHub Pages or similar platforms

## Conclusion: Democratizing Geospatial Analysis

- Web Assembly/Shiny Live removes barriers to geospatial data sharing
- Empowers a wider audience to create and use mapping applications
- Encourages innovation and collaboration in geospatial analysis
