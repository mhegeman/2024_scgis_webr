# 2024 SCGIS Conference Presentation: Shiny Happy People Sharing Geospatial Data

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

Hey there, map enthusiasts and data lovers! 👋🌍📊 Welcome to our GitHub
repo for “Shiny Happy People Sharing Geospatial Data” - this
presentation was part of the 2024 SCGIS Conference.

In this presentation, we (@sayersr and @mhegeman) examine some common
challenges when visualizing your spatial data and sharing those results
with our colleagues. But don’t worry, we’ve got solutions! We introduce
you to Shinylive - a web app framework that works with both R and
Python. With Shinylive you can create lightweight, serverless apps that
are easy to share.

We walk you through building an interactive map that can plot your
spatial data using Leaflet, all while keeping things private. It’s like
having your cake and eating it too! 🍰

We wrap up with a look at the cool benefits of this approach, some
challenges to keep in mind, and exciting ideas for future enhancements.
So dive in, explore our slides, and let’s make sharing geospatial data a
breeze! If you have any questions or just want to geek out about maps,
give us a shout. Happy mapping! 🗺️✨

Demo app: Summer Run Series! Plot the results of your race by uploading
a .tcx file created by your fitness tracker.
