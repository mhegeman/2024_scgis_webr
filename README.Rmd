# 2024 SCGIS Conference Presentation: Shiny Happy People Sharing Geospatial Data

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

Hey there, map enthusiasts and data lovers! 👋🌍📊
Welcome to our GitHub repo for "Shiny Happy People Sharing Geospatial Data" - this presentation was part of the 2024 SCGIS Conference.  

In this presentation, we (@sayersr and @mhegeman) tackle those pesky problems we've all faced when trying to share cool map data with our colleagues. You know, the headaches of pricey servers, software that costs an arm and a leg, and installation processes that make you want to pull your hair out! 😅  

But don't worry, we've got solutions! We introduce you to the awesome world of Shinylive - a nifty web app framework that works with both R and Python. Using some WebAssembly wizardry, we show you how to create super lightweight, serverless apps that'll make your geospatial data sing! 🎵  

We walk you through building an interactive map that can juggle multiple data sources, all while keeping things private and consistent. It's like having your cake and eating it too! 🍰  

We wrap up with a look at the cool benefits of this approach, some challenges to keep in mind, and exciting ideas for future enhancements. Whether you're a seasoned pro or just dipping your toes into the geospatial waters, there's something here for everyone!
So dive in, explore our slides, and let's make sharing geospatial data a breeze! If you have any questions or just want to geek out about maps, give us a shout. Happy mapping! 🗺️✨
